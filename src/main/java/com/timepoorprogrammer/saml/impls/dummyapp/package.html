<p>This package holds code for the dummy application service that comes bundles with the middleware and is used to help
commission the middleware software in hosting.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The code in here corresponds to the DummyApp entity definition found in the idp_and_sp_metadata.xml that comes
with the project, and maps to the routing details held in any property starting with saml.dummyapp in saml.properties.
Only if you are commissioning a completely new service provided by NorthgateArinso will you <b>ever</b> need to
write your own consumer at the SAML middleware.  Its a big job, done when a new service of ours needs to be
made available by the SAML route.  Normally, if you are a bespoke team member you'll be bespoking
assertion consumer processors, and not providing completely new entry points for assertion consumption.</p>
