<p>This package holds code for the WebView (Aurora) NorthgateArinso application/service assertion consumer, which
    differs from the DummyApp consumer in that the WebView consumer is completely stateless to be as quick as
    possible.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>As new NorthgateArinso services are commissioned, new consumers will need to be added (coded and configured)
to the SAML middleware to provide the entry path to those applications via a SAML route visible to the outside world.
Please see http://hrs-dev6.hrs.northgate-is.com/display/SOAStrategy/SAMLAssertion+Processing and its attached
Technical Specification for details.</p>
