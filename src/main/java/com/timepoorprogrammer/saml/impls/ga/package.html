<p>This package holds bespoke code for Goldman Sachs, using the customer prefix code applied
by the hosting team as a directory name under which we organise our code.  The Goldman Sachs solution doesn't
make use of the SAML metadata, as it doesn't use SAML.  Their infrastructure sends us assertions but in a very
simple form. It does make use of the routing configuration, as whether we recieve SAML or not, the middleware
still needs to route to the appropriate MyView instances for the customer.  Note the customer code in hosting is
<i>GA</i> and not GS as would be logical, but is already used.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The authorisation mechanism required by Goldman Sachs uses a shared key MAC architecture and is described on
    the WIKI page
    http://hrs-dev6.hrs.northgate-is.com/display/SOAStrategy/Goldman+Sachs+and+their+custom+authentication.</p>
<p>In the commissioning stage, load the page at the context path/ga/getUserDetails.jsp page to submit an assertion
    to the consumer.  It uses the saml.properties configuration and gives a good end to end test for the consumer.</p>
