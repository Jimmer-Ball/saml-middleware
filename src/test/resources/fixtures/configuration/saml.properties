# This properties file is the SAML metadata configuration's secret twin.  We share SAML metadata with our customers
# but we never share this file with them, instead this is our way of configuring the private parts of our cross domain
# single sign on architecture.
#
# For both SAML PRODUCER CONFIGURATION and SAML CONSUMER CONFIGURATION settings, the second element of the property
# names given in this file MUST match a respective producer entity or consumer entity id in the applicable SAML metadata
# file(s) we've shared with a customer, otherwise this information here is useless and cannot be used by either an
# assertion consumer or assertion producer.  The ids are for matching all the moving parts up, so its assumed the
# codes in the SAML metadata, this file, the ResourceLink customer id, and the MyView customer id all match up. If
# the entity identifiers in the SAML meta need to be different from our internal hosting customer codes then use
# the samlentitytranslation.properties file to provide a translation between a SAML entity identifier and our internal
# hosting customer code.
#
# The SAML PRODUCER CONFIGURATION and SAML CONSUMER CONFIGURATION sections here are where we bind our producer and
# consumer entities to the right LOCAL keystores that hold private keys.  Producers use private keys to sign outgoing
# SAML, and consumers use private keys to decrypt incoming SAML.  The public keys for signing, and the public keys
# for encryption go in the SAML metadata.
#
# For the SAML REDIRECTION CONFIGURATION settings here, the second element of the property name in this file needs to
# match an assertion producer code (the customer) and the third element needs to match an assertion consumer code (the
# application) they are wanting to reach.  This way we can configure customer specific URLs to redirect to for a given
# application or service within our hosting environment.
#
# The SAML REDIRECTION CONFIGURATION is also where we configure what an assertion consumer will do following
# assertion validation.  There is no point just checking the assertion received and doing nothing, we have
# to re-direct to an application that is right for the customer. So, after assertion validation, the consumer has to
# get the app to authorise the user via a service interface on the app behind the scenes, and (if successfull) has
# to then redirect the user's browser to go into the remote application via a backdoor. So this means identifying the
# URL for the Authoriser service interface on the customer's instance of a remote application (say MyView) we'd use to 
# get the application to authorise our user (see serviceUrl), identifying the backdoor URL (see baseUrl) into
# the application we need to redirect to following successful authorisation, where we go on error, and finally
# identifying the characteristics of the cookie and transport we must use to ensure the cookie gets sent to the app
# backdoor the redirected request.  This last bit is crucial.
#
# The cookie configuration comes in two parts, one for the temporary session indicating a user is authorised, and one
# for routing purposes within hosting.  These are the "sessionCookie" and "arrowPointCookie" sections.
#
# The "arrowPointCookie" settings are to allow for routing in our hosting network architecture. Hosting
# makes use of context switches that add an "arrowpoint" cookie to allow the route to a given application/service
# type (say MyView) for a given customer to become fixed for a given session.  So, if a user is trying to access
# TimeWarner's MyView, the first time through, the context switch will add a cookie to the exchange indicating a
# particular Apache reverse proxy should be routed via.  All subsequent requests then get routed to the right
# instance of the application for a given customer. So when a user attempts to access an application via the SAML 
# middleware, we will redirect the customer's browser to the application backdoor of the right "logical" service 
# (say MyView) for the customer following authorisation, so we need to tell the lunking context switch in hosting 
# were to route to, so we can make sure the redirection ends up at the right instance of the application without exposing 
# a hosting internal host URL to a customer's browser. So the middleware adds on the arrowpoint configuration as a cookie 
# to the response we send back to the browser to ensure correct context switch routing takes place.  We have to do this, 
# as otherwise a user could be redirected to an instance of an application that doesn't know anything about their 
# temporary session.
#
# Note: The configuration currently in here is all for the example remote application included in the project.  It is
# not production quality configuration. For example, the customer specific application backdoor access points must be
# HTTPS in production, as they tell a browser in someone else's environment how to redirect through an application
# backdoor.  Its only HTTP here to allow you to test it locally.  So, don't roll this out in production without
# reading the "How do you set this up?" section below.
#
# How do you set this up?
# -----------------------
#
# 1) Use the right runtime environment: The setup currently in here assumes that the SAML assertion consumer/producer
# is running in Java 1.6.  It has currently (28/07/2010) only been tested on JBoss 5.1.0 and Tomcat 6.0.20.  See the
# WIKI at http://hrs-dev6.hrs.northgate-is.com/display/SOAStrategy/SAMLAssertion+Processing for more details.
#
# 2) Generate the keys we'll need to do decryption/encryption and signing/signature verification: SAML sent from a
# customer needs to be encrypted according to our specification at their end, and decrypted using our private key when
# it arrives, and SAML sent from a customer needs to signed at their end using their private key, and needs to be
# signature checked at ours when it arrives. The rules are, if we want a customer to encrypt data they send to us, it
# is our responsibility to generate a public/private key pair, and if a customer wants us to check their digital
# signature on incoming SAML they send to us, it is their responsibility to generate a public/private key pair.
#
# Within the project's example setup provided, two self signed key pairs have already been created for you. In order
# to run the example setup (management UI) you need to copy the two files serviceKeyStore.jks and clientKeyStore.jks
# from the fixtures/keystores directory to the JBoss conf subdirectory or Tomcat conf subdirectory.  The file
# serviceKeyStore.jks holds a sample private key used by us as a service provider to decrypt received SAML2 assertions.
# The file clientKeyStore.jks holds the private key used by an identity provider to sign outgoing SAML (both SAML1.1
# and SAML2).  Read the WIKI for more details.
#
# 3) Share your public configuration with the customer: A customer sending us assertions cannot encrypt the assertions
# without having the public key part of our key pair we've generated in the previous step, and cannot send assertions
# to us without knowing the public address of the application specific assertion consumer.  Reciprocally, we cannot
# verify the signature on any inbound SAML unless we've been given the public key part of a key pair generated by a
# customer, and we know what configuration to apply when an assertion from a given customer arrives in our
# infrastructure. This is what the SAML metadata is for. See idp_and_sp_metadata.xml in fixtures/metadata for the
# example details.  This file holds the two public keys (one for signature verification and one for encryption)
# expressed as X509Certificates and provides the public facing URL a customer uses to address our application
# specific assertion consumers.
#
# How did we generate the self-signed certificate information in the metadata?: This was done using part of the script
# createSelfSignedCerts.bash in fixtures/scripts.  You should see that the content of those certificate files 
# (under fixtures/keystores/*.cer) is exactly the same as the X509 sections in the metadata.  So, the customer sends 
# us the metadata for entity, say "idp_saml2" which is responsible for sending us SAML, and we send them the entity 
# descriptor for say "MyView".  The entity descriptor for "idp_saml2" holds the public certificate we would use for
# checking the signature of anything they send us, and the entity descriptor for "MyView" holds the public certificate 
# they would use to encrypt SAML they send to us.
#
# Note that in the metadata file provided with the project, the endpoints are local URL on my development machine.
# If you want to run the example infrastructure locally, change the URLs to point to your own FQDN, not my machine.
#
# In production terms these endpoint URL MUST be HTTPS and MUST be public facing internet ready URL provided by hosting
# that define the addressable entry points for application specific SAML assertion consumption within our hosting
# environment.  They aren't URL you decide, but hosting decide on for you prior to you sending the customer the entity
# descriptor for our assertion consumer service (say "MyView").
#
# So, due to our hosting network architecture, this means the customer will get a metadata entity description we send
# them describing say "MyView" that MUST include the publically addressable endpoints, and we on the host(s) that
# hold our SAMLAssertion consumer will have "almost" the same entity description for MyView.  I say "almost" as the
# key difference will be that our local metadata held by the consumer inside our hosting infrastructure will need to
# hold the LOCAL URL for the endpoints, as by the time the request gets from the public address the customer uses on
# the edge of hosting to the SAML assertion consumer buried deep within hosting behind the context switch and reverse
# proxy, the URL will be completely different, or LOCAL.  In which case the assertion consumer to compare the address
# in the request to the local path the consumer is running on, and if they differ, will reject the request.
#
# This isn't an issue if testing the setup locally, but is a big issue in production deployments.  If testing locally
# just amend ALL the location URL in the metadata to your local machine FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) and then
# copy the file into your Tomcat conf directory, so it can be picked up by the assertion producer pretending
# to be a customer, and the official MyView assertion consumer.
#
# 4) Copy this file into the Tomcat conf directory if testing locally.  If in a production setup in hosting
# this file would need to hold amended and valid details for all the options below.
#
# 5) Test this middleware with the dummy application the build comes with.  Navigate to
# http://middlewarehost:port/SAMLWeb to show the management UI and follow the options there.
#
# 6) Test the middleware with the target applications within hosting by getting the redirection configuration right.
#
# 7) Provide the customer with the public facing metadata to allow them to route through to our consumer.
#
# 8) Acceptance test with the customer to ensure an assertion from the customer allows access to the application

# ================================================
#           SAML REDIRECTION CONFIGURATION
# ================================================
# For every customer (a producer of SAML) that wants to access a given application via an application's assertion
# consumer proxy there needs to be information regarding how we hand-off to the application following assertion
# validation. So for each application the customer wants to access, there needs to be customer and application
# specific section below holding the following information:
#
# 1) baseUrl: For a given customer, the baseUrl of the target application needs to be known.  This is a backdoor
# entry point to the applicable target application for a customer and is used by an application assertion consumer when
# redirecting a user's browser following successfull application session authorisation.  In production this MUST be an
# HTTPS address as it needs to be a secure redirection.
#
# 2) serviceUrl: For a given customer, the back-channel Url to the target application from where we can get hold of a
# temporary HTTP session that indicates the user is authorised to view the application.  In production, this needn't
# be an HTTPS connection as its all within the middleware to application flow.  It depends on whether the middleware
# lives on the edge of hosting or within hosting.
#
# 3) errorUrl: The URL our middleware will redirect the user's browser to if there is an error in the processing,
# either in terms of assertion validation, or in terms of silent login failure. In production this my well be a public
# URL somewhere in the CUSTOMER's infrastructure, or could be a page on the middleware (as here).  Its up to the 
# customer, and the operating parameters of the hosting environment within which their application is deployed.  The
# middleware needs to be able to route to it.
#
# 4) sessionCookieDomain: This should be the domain of the target application so we can be specific about how the
# cookie should be made available by the user's browser on redirection.  Note if the middleware and the target app
# are on different hosts then you need a part FQDN (e.g. uk.rebushr.com), and if the middleware and the target app
# are on the same host then you can probably get away with a full FQDN (e.g srv-ws12.uk.rebushr.com)
#
# 5) sessionCookiePath: This should be the URL path under which the cookie becomes active/accessible.  So for
# MyView for example, think MyView/concerto.  This setting allows us to use multiple JSESSIONID values for multiple
# applications each of which have a different sessionCookiePath (within the application) URL.  So that makes the
# these particular cookies accessible and unique per application.
#
# 6) sessionCookieName: Non Java based applications may well NOT use JSESSIONID as the application's cookie name, so
# the cookie name must be provided for the assertion consumer.  Also, the JSESSIONID approach assumes a host cookie
# can be over-written by the middleware on re-direction, which will not always be the case.
#
# 7) sessionCookieSecureFlag: Should we be sending the cookie out securely?  This depends on whether the URL in the
# baseUrl is an HTTPS call or not.  If it is, then this should be true, otherwise then this should be false.  For
# development and local testing purposes this is false.  For production it MUST be true.
#
# 8) sessionCookieHttpOnlyFlag: If set to true, the cookie cannot be picked up by JavaScript, making it more "secure".
#
# 9) arrowPointCookieDomain: The domain to which the arrowpoint cookie used by hosting's context switch applies.  This
# would usually be the FQDN of the service/application the context switch redirects to.  If testing make sure this
# points to your box's FQDN (as in this example).
#
# 10) arrowPointCookiePath: The default for this is "/"
#
# 11) arrowPointCookieName: The default for this is ARPT
#
# 12) arrowPointCookieValue: The value for the arrow point cookie.  This value maps an instance of MyView for a given
# customer from the context switch in hosting, and the correct values will only be known by them.
#
# 13) arrowPointCookieSecureFlag: The URL to the application backdoor will (in production) be HTTPS, so this is normally
# true.
#
# 14) arrowPointCookieHttpOnlyFlag: If set to true, the cookie cannot be picked up by JavaScript, making it more "secure".
