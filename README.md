This is SAML middleware written to use the SAML core library.  It works as
middelware sitting in your network processing SAML assertions, either
producing or consuming, either SAML 1.1 or SAML 2, all driven by 
meta-data just like Shibboleth.

Please check it out, and run the tests to get an idea of how the middleware
really works.
